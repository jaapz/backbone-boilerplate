Backbone Boilerplate
====================

This is a backbone boilerplate based on [this one](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate). 

It uses a lot of @tbranyen's boilerplate files and file structure, but differs mainly because:

* it adds bootstrap
* removes html5 boilerplate
* uses bower instead of jam
* doesn't use grunt.js

## Get started

Clone this repository:

    git clone --q --depth 0 git@github.com:jaapz/backbone-boilerplate.git 
To start using this boilerplate, install bower (using npm):

    npm install bower -g

And install the javascript libraries:

    bower install
